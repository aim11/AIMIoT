# AIRIoT 
Distributed commonsense AI reasoning framework for IoT applications

AIRIoT is powered by Jena rule based reasoner https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/ and 
ActiveMQ messaging service http://activemq.apache.org/ backed by RDF4J graph database with SPARQL query support.
Android mobile reasoners support MQTT and COAP protocols.

This framework is based on the paper:
Semantic Reasoning for Context-aware Internet of Things Applications. Maarala AI, Su X, Riekki J
(2016), in IEEE Internet of Things Journal, DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2016.2587060.
